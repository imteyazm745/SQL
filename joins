JOINS :- 
JOINs are useful for allowing us to pull data from multiple tables. This is both simple and powerful all at the same time.
With the addition of the JOIN statement to our toolkit, we will also be adding the ON statement.
We use ON clause to specify a JOIN condition which is a logical statement to combine the table in FROM and JOIN statements.
    SELECT orders.*
    FROM orders
    JOIN accounts
    ON orders.account_id = accounts.id;
