A new column that is a manipulation of the existing columns in our database.
Creating a new column that is a combination of existing columns is known as a derived column (or "calculated" or "computed" column).
Usually we want to give a name, or "alias," to your new column using the AS keyword.
This derived column, and its alias, are generally only temporary, existing just for the duration of your query. The next time you run a query and access this table, the new column will not be there.
If you are deriving the new column from existing columns using a mathematical expression, then these familiar mathematical operators will be useful:
* (Multiplication)
+ (Addition)
- (Subtraction)
/ (Division)
Consider this example:
SELECT id, (standard_amt_usd/total_amt_usd)*100 AS std_percent, total_amt_usd
FROM orders
LIMIT 10;
The following two statements have very different end results:
Standard_qty / standard_qty + gloss_qty + poster_qty
standard_qty / (standard_qty + gloss_qty + poster_qty)
It is likely that you mean to do the calculation as written in statement number 2!

Q1. Create a column that divides the standard_amt_usd by the standard_qty to find the unit price for standard paper for each order. Limit the results to the first 10 orders, and include the id and account_id fields.
select id, account_id, standard_amt_usd/standard_qty as unit_price
from orders
limit 10;
