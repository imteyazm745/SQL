Introduction to Logical Operators
In the next concepts, you will be learning about Logical Operators. Logical Operators include:
LIKE This allows you to perform operations similar to using WHERE and =, but for cases when you might not know exactly what you are looking for.
IN This allows you to perform operations similar to using WHERE and =, but for more than one condition.
NOT This is used with IN and LIKE to select all of the rows NOT LIKE or NOT IN a certain condition.
AND & BETWEEN These allow you to combine operations where all combined conditions must be true.
OR This allows you to combine operations where at least one of the combined conditions must be true.
The LIKE operator is extremely useful for working with text. You will use LIKE within a WHERE clause. The LIKE operator is frequently used with %. The % tells us that we might want any number of characters leading up to a particular set of characters or following a certain set of characters, as we saw with the google syntax above.

Q. Use the accounts table to find
1. All the companies whose names start with 'C'.
        SELECT name
        FROM accounts
        WHERE name LIKE 'C%';

2. All companies whose names contain the string 'one' somewhere in the name.
        SELECT name
        FROM accounts
        WHERE name LIKE '%one%';

3. All companies whose names end with 's'.
        SELECT name
        FROM accounts
        WHERE name LIKE '%s';

IN - In command allows us to filter data based on several possible values. IN requires single quotation marks around non-numerical data. note you can include an apostrophe by putting two single quotes together. For example, Macy's in our workspace would be 'Macy''s'.

Example 1
Select * from demo.accounts
Where name IN (‘Walmart’, ‘Apple’)

Example 2
Select * from demo.orders
Where account_id IN (1001,1021’)
