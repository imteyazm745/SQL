Using the WHERE statement, we can display subsets of tables based on conditions that must be met. You can also think of the WHERE command as filtering the data.
Where command is used after from command and before order by/limit command.
Common symbols used in WHERE statements include:
> (greater than)
< (less than)
>= (greater than or equal to)
<= (less than or equal to)
= (equal to)
!= (not equal to)
