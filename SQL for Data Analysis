SQL FOR DATA ANALYSIS

SQL is easy to understand.
Traditional databases allow us to access data directly.
Traditional databases allow us to audit and replicate our data.
SQL is a great tool for analyzing multiple tables at once.
SQL allows you to analyze more complex questions than dashboard tools like Google Analytics.

The key to SQL is understanding statements. A few statements include:
CREATE TABLE is a statement that creates a new table in a database.
DROP TABLE is a statement that removes a table in a database.
SELECT allows you to read data and display it. This is called a query.

SELECT indicates which column(s) you want to be given the data for.
FROM specifies from which table(s) you want to select the columns. Notice the columns need to exist in this table.
