SQL FOR DATA ANALYSIS

SQL is easy to understand.
Traditional databases allow us to access data directly.
Traditional databases allow us to audit and replicate our data.
SQL is a great tool for analyzing multiple tables at once.
SQL allows you to analyze more complex questions than dashboard tools like Google Analytics.

The key to SQL is understanding statements. A few statements include:
CREATE TABLE is a statement that creates a new table in a database.
DROP TABLE is a statement that removes a table in a database.
SELECT allows you to read data and display it. This is called a query.
